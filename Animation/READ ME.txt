This folder contains the files for the animation of the second hand. Each bar is grayed out, but for every second that passes, a bar is blacked out. 
There should be 59 bars, but because I'm a dumbass there is 61. Use the "counterfix.png" image to obscure the last two bars for the 
Portal version (just paste that bit over the bars), and the "fixup.png" for the Portal 2 version. I had to make all 61 of these images by hand 
(for some reason I thought a minute had 61 seconds) and I dind't feel like remaking all of them. It was a hell to gray out all the bars.

If you're importing this animation into GWD, it's important to note that animation runs at 15fps. Meaning that unless you want 4 minutes to pass every minute, 
you'll need to make 14 more copies of every single .png file in this folder so that it comes to 900 total images. 15 per second. It's not hard, just ctrl+a, ctrl+c, 
and then hit ctrl+v exactly 14 times. They'll all be in order still. Then import every image into GWD.

If you use Facer, god be with you. I have never used it and I have no idea how it works so you're on your own champ.

I would have uploaded all 900 images, but github limited the upload to 100. Fuck maybe I could just .zip it or tar it. Idk not my problem.
