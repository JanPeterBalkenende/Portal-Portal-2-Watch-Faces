Hi! Cave Johnson here.

This watch face has been filled with a billion little gizmos that that are going to travel into your bloodstream and pump you full with experimental chemicals and RNA molecules into your tumors. Don't stress yourself thinking about it. My bean-counters have assured me there is atleast a 62% chance of it 'being fine'. Yes, air-quotes were part of their attempt at persuasion.

The backdrop of this watch face has been produced from the finest asbestos, whereas the time screen has been crafted in our finest department, where the boys spent their time creating a display that's backlit through the power of x-rays. That's right. This display is so crystal clear you can read it with your eyes closed.

Here's what the lab boys managed to fit into this magnificent thing

- Date displays at the top of the display
- The time is in a 24hr digital format
- Your heart rate is shown next to the hour clock
- Your velocity is shown next to the minute clock
- The testing progression bar is animated to count the second in the minute

In short, this clock offers everything a motivated test subject needs.
